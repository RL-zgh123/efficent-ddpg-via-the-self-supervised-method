# Efficent-DDPG-via-Self-Supervised-Method
# Brief Description
* Our code is based on Mofan's RL tutorial code https://github.com/princewen/tensorflow_practice/tree/master/RL/Basic-DDPG.

* DDPG_ss.py is our new design. Respectively, DDPG_origin.py is the baseline algorithm.

* We use independent placeholders for each object instead of original global ones.
